# Tuckin.ca

**Tuckin.ca** is a simple, no-nonsense online food ordering platform.  
Think of it like a **shopping mall**, but for food — restaurants set up their own space, customers visit, place orders, and tuck in.

No third-party delivery drivers, no crazy fees, no gimmicks. Just a clean digital space for restaurants and customers to meet.

## Why Tuckin?

- Restaurants shouldn’t have to pay 20-30% commission to greedy apps.
- Customers shouldn’t need to download 5 apps to get a damn pizza.
- Food ordering should be simple.
- Tuckin just **connects** restaurants and customers — that's it.

## How It Works

### For Restaurants:
- Create an account.
- Set up your menu (items, prices, descriptions, photos).
- Offer pickup or manage your own delivery if you want.
- Pay a tiny fee ($0.50 per order) to stay on the platform.

### For Customers:
- Visit Tuckin.ca.
- Browse restaurants near you.
- Order directly from the restaurant.
- Pickup your food or get it delivered by the restaurant’s own delivery team.

**Payments:**  
Handled directly between customer and restaurant (just like walking into a store).  
No middleman sitting on your money.

*(Subject to change if better lightweight options come up.)*
